@description

Full backwards compatibility with $routeProvider is **not** a primary goal this project. However, we are trying 
to have a clear migration path from $routeProvider to $stateProvider, and to use compatible terminology where this 
is possible and makes sense. At this point, most features of $routeProvider cleanly map to a sub-set of $stateProvider
functionality, so that providing a compatibility shim that allows applications to be migrated bit by bit is feasible.
